# Reilly's InstaClone
This is an implied replica of instagram in terms of functionalities as it was launched. It is nothing fancy and it has helped me learn.

## Troubles
- I was unable to implement the followers system and hence it is not part of the app
- The frontend is not as appealing just bare-bones

### Tech Used
- HTML
- CSS
- DJANGO-TEMPLATES
- PYTHON

### External sources used
I have to say I relied heavely on sites like stackoverflow, geekforgeeks and w3schools to unblock myself.

## Aspirations
With time I hope to be able to make an exact replica of the site.
